A-frame Solar System Project
## Solar System
The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

In this project, I will build my own solar system using A-Frame. And add textures and animations to it.
